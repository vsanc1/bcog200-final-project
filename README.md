# Ping Pong Game with Power Ups
[insert image here]

-For my final project, I intend to make a ping pong game. It has been done a lot, so in order to make it more original, I think I am going to add power up functions. The power ups might make the paddle larger or move faster. I will also try to add unique graphics.

## What is this game?
  a. The project will have a function that connects / syncs your arrow keys with the paddles.     
  
  b. The project will have a function that makes the ball move back and forth when it makes contact with the paddles.     

  c. The project will have a function that creates power ups and applies them to the paddle  

## Installation 

#### Install the required dependencies
pip install pygame

#### Run the game in your terminal
python final_project.py




## Testing
When running the game, you will see a screen with paddles and a ball. You can control the left paddle with W and S, and the right paddle with your UP and DOWN arrow keys.  The paddles should not move off the screen. The ball should bounce off the top and bottom, and reset in the middle if you do not hit it with a paddle. Movement should be smooth. You will be playing against yourself, and there will be a scoreboard at the top of the screen. If you fail to hit a ball, the paddle that sent that ball gains a point. Once you have reached a certain point threshold, you may press G to gain a powerup.
