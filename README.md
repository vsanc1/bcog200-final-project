# Ping Pong Game with Power Ups
hello!

-For my final project, I intend to make a ping pong game. It has been done a lot, so in order to make it more original, I think I am going to add power up functions. The power ups might make the paddle larger or move faster. I will also try to add unique graphics.

## What is this game?
  a. The project will have a function that connects / syncs your arrow keys with the paddles.     
  
  b. The project will have a function that makes the ball move back and forth when it makes contact with the paddles.     

  c. The project will have a function that creates power ups and applies them to the paddle  

## Installation 

#Install the required dependencies
pip install pygame

#Run the game in your terminal
python final_project.py




## Testing
You can test the file by running it in your terminal. You will first need to type: pip install pygame. Then, you can run my final_project.py file. A screen should show up with two paddles, which you will be able to control with keys in the future.
