## CHECKIN-1:
hello!

-For my final project, I intend to make a ping pong game. It has been done a lot, so in order to make it more original, I think I am going to add power up functions. The power ups might make the paddle larger or move faster. I will also try to add unique graphics.

-functions: 
  a. The project will have a function that connects / syncs your arrow keys with the paddles. 
  b. The project will have a function that makes the ball move back and forth when it makes contact with the paddles. c. The project will have a function that creates power ups and applies them to the paddle

## CHECKIN-2:
hello!

-Documentation file: So, my project is pretty much the same. I have created a window with a nice background and the paddles. I am going to use pygame for my project. I am going to add a function for the ball, and a function that allows the ball to bounce off of the paddles. I have decided to add background music and sound effects when the paddle hits the ball, which will probably be implemented into the game loop function and then the paddle/ball hit loop function (which I have not created yet). There will still be a power up function which increases paddle length and speed. I will have to make a function to connect the W S and up and down arrow keys to control both paddles.

-Test file: You can test the file by running it in your terminal. You will first need to type: pip install pygame. Then, you can run my final_project.py file. A screen should show up with two paddles, which you will be able to control with keys in the future.
