CHECKIN-1:
hello!

-For my final project, I intend to make a ping pong game. It has been done a lot, so in order to make it more original, I think I am going to add power up functions. The power ups might make the paddle larger or move faster. I will also try to add unique graphics.

-functions: 
  a. The project will have a function that connects / syncs your arrow keys with the paddles. 
  b. The project will have a function that makes the ball move back and forth when it makes contact with the paddles. c. The project will have a function that creates power ups and applies them to the paddle

CHECKIN-2:
hello!

-Documentation file:
-Test file: You can test the file by running it in your terminal. A screen should show up with two paddles.
