hello!
1. For my final project, I intend to make a ping pong game.
It has been done a lot, so in order to make it more original, I think I am going to add power up functions.
The power ups might make the paddle larger or move faster.
I will also try to add unique graphics.
2. functions:
    a. The project will have a function that connects / syncs your arrow keys with the paddles.
    b. The project will have a function that makes the ball move back and forth when it makes contact with the paddles.
    c. The project will have a function that creates power ups and applies them to the paddle.
